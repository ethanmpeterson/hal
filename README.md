# Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)
This repository contains a collection of shared header files for a hardware
abstraction layer. This repository is a work in progress. I update this
repository each time I need to add a standard interface for a hardware
peripheral I am using. I intend to utilize the headers across different projects
to maintain a shared IO interface regardless of the underlying
hardware.
